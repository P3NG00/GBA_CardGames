IF UNABLE TO BUILD make sure that all utilized instances of templated classes are defined in their cpp with their respective values
example: I was getting the error below:
undefined reference to 'void card_pile<106>::deal_card_to<7>(card_pile<7>&)'
adding the line below in cg_card_pile.cpp fixed the build error:
template void card_pile<CardPileMax>::deal_card_to<CardPileHandMax>(card_pile<CardPileHandMax>&);

// TODO Computer difficulties
(// TODO IMPLEMENT FIRST FOR TESTING)
Baby - Will choose to play or discard random cards at random times
Easy - Will attempt to choose playable cards at random
Normal - Will prefer to score when possible, only attacking or discarding when necessary
Mean - Will prefer to attack when possible, scoring if no attack is possible, discarding when necessary

// TODO change most functions to use references (&) where possible
