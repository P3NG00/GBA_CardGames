IF UNABLE TO BUILD make sure that all utilized instances of templated classes are defined in their cpp with their respective values
example: I was getting the error below:
undefined reference to 'void card_pile<106>::deal_card_to<7>(card_pile<7>&)'
adding the line below in cg_card_pile.cpp fixed the build error:
template void card_pile<CardPileMax>::deal_card_to<CardPileHandMax>(card_pile<CardPileHandMax>&);

// TODO Computer difficulties
(// TODO IMPLEMENT FIRST FOR TESTING)
Baby - Will choose to play or discard random cards at random times
Easy - Will attempt to choose playable cards at random
Normal - Will prefer to score when possible, only attacking or discarding when necessary
Mean - Will prefer to attack when possible, scoring if no attack is possible, discarding when necessary

// TODO change most functions to use references (&) where possible

// TODO make 4 player game
TODO make 'player display' class that takes pointer to player and displays ther hand.
TODO 'player display' will hold a position that the display will be draw from
TODO 'player display' will hold an offset value to draw the other playing fields apart from the hand
TODO 'player display' will be able to be updated with a new player pointer to display, usually when the turn ends and the next player starts
TODO 'player display' will be able to handle vertical and horizontal display to be able to be placed on all 4 sides of the screen
TODO 'player display' will only display the cards of the current player. the other players cards will have their hands shown only as card backs to hide their cards. the roll, speed, and safety pile fields should still be visible
- the player who is currently playing will be displayed on the bottom of the screen, next player will be on the right side, next player will be on top, next will be on the left
TODO implement vertical display for player hands
TODO display current player index somewhere on screen
TODO fill names with 'Player x' with x being the player index from 1-4 (make able to display custom names later)
